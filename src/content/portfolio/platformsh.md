During my time working with Platform.sh, I focused on front-end development for their main website and contributed significantly to their bespoke React component library. The website was built using Gatsby, which enabled fast, modern static site generation and a robust content workflow. I also utilized Storybook to document, test, and showcase UI components, ensuring consistency and reusability across the platform. This workflow streamlined collaboration between design and engineering and greatly improved the product’s scalability and maintainability.
