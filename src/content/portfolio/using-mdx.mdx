During my time working on the Banner CMS project for Samsung, I played a key role in developing a content management system specifically designed for large format displays. Although I contributed to the frontend interfaces, my primary focus was on the player application—a crucial component of the system, built as an Electron app using JavaScript.

The player was engineered to communicate with the CMS via its API, regularly requesting the latest schedule in JSON format. Upon receiving a schedule update, the player would automatically download the required content assets and seamlessly display them on the device. This included correctly orchestrating both the timing and the transitions between content pieces to match the schedule specifications precisely.
