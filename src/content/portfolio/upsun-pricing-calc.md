During my time working on the Upsun pricing page, I designed and developed an interactive pricing calculator that allows users to configure their projects and instantly receive estimated costs. This required architecting a robust system using React and Redux for state management, which made it easy to accommodate frequent changes to the pricing model as requirements evolved. I focused on building clean, maintainable code with extensibility in mind, ensuring that new features and pricing tiers could be added without friction. Additionally, I implemented support for multiple currencies, allowing users from different regions to view accurate, localized pricing.
