While working on the Upsun website and bespoke component library, I focused on creating a highly flexible and maintainable front-end ecosystem. One of my key contributions was architecting a design token pipeline using Style Dictionary to transform tokens from Figma into usable JavaScript objects. This approach provided a single source of truth for colors, spacing, typography, and other styles, making it seamless to implement theme updates and ensure consistency across the platform.

I also implemented comprehensive theming support, enabling light and dark modes and making it easy to extend or update the visual design. The component library was fully migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript, dramatically improving type safety and code maintainability. Together, these efforts resulted in a scalable, themeable design system with rapid feedback loops for both design and engineering teams, empowering smooth collaboration and faster feature delivery.
