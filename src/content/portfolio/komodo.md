Worked on the foundation of Thermo Fisher's design system, Komodo. Built the foundational CSS and HTML for core "plain" components, providing a base layer of styles that enabled the React team to create consistent, styled components. Both sets of components were hosted and documented on Storybook for usage across teams.

In addition to the component work, created an automated pipeline to extract, process, and convert design tokens from a Sketch file (managed in Abstract) into CSS variables. This ensured that updated design decisions could quickly propagate into the codebase through the Abstract API, keeping the system cohesive and enabling rapid iteration between design and engineering.
